# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Jeremy D Walker*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

Orange - signal
Brown - ground
red - power

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

Pin 9

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

angle - pos is configured to vary between 0 and 180 (and then 180 to 0)
speed - increment is set to 1

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**

In this part of the project, I used the arrow template from google and then implemented a two button ISR design:
